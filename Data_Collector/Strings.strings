"Welcome to the iSENSE Data Collector iOS Application, developed by UMass Lowell undergraduates Jeremy Poulin and Michael Stowell of the ECG/iSENSE team under Fred Martin. 

The Engaging Computing Group \"develops new technologies to enable learners - youth, teachers, undergraduates, and others - be creative in science, engineering, and computing, and studies how these technologies improve learning.\"

iSENSE exists as a branch off of the ECG, which involves \“teachers and kids in inquiry-rich science projects with electronic data collection.\” Data collected from iSENSE experiments may be found on the isenseproject.org website.

This iOS application is essentially the general data collection iOS platform to utilize the iSENSE visualization tools.  With this application, you may simply contribute session data to an existing iSENSE experiment.  iOS devices host many sensors that can all be utilized, should your device support them, to record data and visualize it on the iSENSE website.

The purpose of the Data Collector application is to enable people of all ages to take advantage of the hardware sensors iOS offers and use them to take real, personalized data and visualize it using a variety of visualization tools offered by the iSENSE website.

This application will also enable a user to manually key in data live using the manual-entry portion of this app.  All the user needs to know is his or her experiment and login information and he or she is ready to go.

In order to use this application, you must have an account on isenseproject.org.";

"This is a guide designed to help explain to you how to use our iSENSE Data Collector application.

You may notice the two buttons at the bottom of this screen labeled \"Automatic\" and \"Manual\".  Let\'s first talk about the Automatic portion of this application.

--------

AUTOMATIC ENTRY:

Automatic is the subapplication you will use should you want to record data using the sensors built into your Android device.  Here, you can record a set amount of data with a specified sample interval and specified recording time.

The layout presented here is a simplistic 3-step button layout with 3 menu options.  Let\'s first dicuss the 3 menu items.

Login: Since this application uploads data to the iSENSE website, you must have an account on iSENSE to do so.  This menu option allows you to login to your account.  Your login credentials will be encrypted and stored on your device so that you should not have to login again once you do so once.

Media: Here, you may takes pictures or videos.  Videos are not currently supported by the iSENSE website, so these are simply saved to your SD card.  However, pictures taken will be associated with the next data set you record.  The first picture you take will be associated with the session your data set is uploaded to, and remaining pictures will be associated with the experiment this data set is being uploaded to.  All pictures are also saved to your SD card.  Once you finish recording a data set, the array of media is cleared so you can take more pictures to associate with the next data set you record.

Sync Time: This menu option is slightly more intricate, so we have included an explanation there as to how it works.  Essentially, \"synchronizing time\" in this application will allow multiple devices on the same network to record data using a host device\'s exact clock time.

Now that you understand the menu options available to you, let\'s begin with a typical usage of this application.  As the 3 buttons on this layout indicate, using this subapplication is a simple 3-step process.

Step 1: The first step is to set up your session to record data for.  Selecting this button will pop up a dialog that provides you multiple text fields, check boxes, and buttons.  First, you should enter your session name, or the name of the data set you would like to record.  Next is the sample interval, or the rate in milliseconds that data will be collected at.  For example, a sample interval of 50 means you\'ll be recording 20 points per second.  The fastest rate you\'re allowed to record data at is 50 milliseconds since this is the fastest, tested, consistent rate at which good, non-repetitive data can be collected at.  The last text field in this dialog is the test length, or the time in seconds that you want to be recording data for.  By default, we set up the test length to be 600 seconds, or 10 minutes.  Below this text field is a checkbox to remember your sample interval and test length.  By checking this off, the next time you setup a session, your values you enter into these text fields will be remembered.  However, since these two text fields supply default values, you do are not required to enter anything here.  Your session name on the other hand is required and will always save and carry over to your next data set recording, unless you change it.  Now it\'s time to select an experiment (or not).  By selecting the \"Select Experiment\" button, you will be presented yet another dialog that prompts you to either enter the ID of the experiment on iSENSE that you would like to upload to, browse a list of experiment and select one, or scan an experiment\'s QR code.  Once you are satisfied with your selection and select \"OK\", a list of the data fields and associated sensors required to record such data is presented in another dialog.  Here, based off of common devices running the version of Android your device is running, we will make a prediction as to which types of sensor data are compatible with the sensors in your device.  You may select which sensory data you would like to record here as well.  When finished with this step, you will be brought back to the Step 1 dialog again.  Should you be unsure of which experiment you\'d like to upload to yet, or if you don\'t have internet connectivity to find your experiment or select compatible fields, you may select the checkbox to select an experiment later.  Once everything is set up here, you are complete with Step 1, and you will see the Step 2 button become enabled.

Step 2: Unlike the other buttons in this application, you must press and hold this button to activate it.  Once you do so, portions of the application will turn green, the Step 1, 2, and 3 buttons will disappear, and you will be presented with a slightly different layout.  The Step 2 button becomes a button that you must press and hold to stop recording data.  Above it is a text field that will read off your setup information (such as your session name and sample interval).  The text field below this button indicates time elapsed in seconds, along with a data point count.  Now you\'re recording data!  The orientation of the device will lock in it\'s current position while inside the application.  However, while recording data, you may now use your device\'s home button to leave our application and go do other things on your phone - we\'ll still be recording data for you.  You may not hit the power button on your device though, since this pauses all Android sensors and thus we cannot retrieve data.  When you are done recording data, you may hold the layout\'s button down that states \"STOP (Press and Hold)\".  The layout will return to it\'s original state, and you\'ll be presented a dialog that let\'s you enter a description for your data set.  You may now either save or delete your data set.

Step 3: Assuming you\'ve saved your data set, you may either go back to Step 1 and keep recording more data sets, or you may upload your data sets with Step 3.  This step requires internet connectivity along with being logged into the application with your iSENSE account.  The Step 3 button will be enabled any time you have data sets to upload, and disabled when there are no more data sets saved.  Your data sets will be listed in blocks, similar to the blocks in the sensor selection dialog in Step 1.  Each data set \"block\" will provide your session name on top, your experiment in the lower left (or \"No Exp.\" if you have not selected one for recording), your description in the lower right, and a checkmark in the upper right.  Prepended to your session name is also a label indicating whether or not this data set is just data or data with an associated picture.  Performing a single tap on this box changes the icon in the upper right to a checkmark or an \"X\", indicating whether or not you would like to upload this data set when the Upload button on the bottom of the dialog is selected.  Pressing and holding a data set pops up a new dialog that allows you to rename or delete a data set.  If your data set has no associated experiment, this is where a third option will pop up in this dialog allowing you to now select an experiment.  When ready, you may press the Upload key to begin uploading all of your data sets.  Data sets that succeed will be removed from this view and will be presented on the iSENSE website.  Data sets that fail to upload will remain there for you so you may try to upload it again in the future.

With that, you have the basic knowledge required to collect Android sensor data and upload it to iSENSE!  The Automatic subapplication should now hopefully seem clear and easy to use.

--------

MANUAL ENTRY:

Perhaps you do not want to record data using Android\'s built-in sensors. With the manual subapplication, you will be able to fetch an experiment\'s fields, manually enter data you recorded, and upload the data set to iSENSE.

The manual application will first ask you to select an experiment.  Just as in the Automatic subapplication, you can either manually enter your experiment\'s number, browse experiments and locate yours, or scan a QR code.  Upon selecting an experiment, the device will list off all of the experiment\'s data fields for you to manually enter data.  Note: time, latitude, and longitude will all be automatically filled in for you when you choose to save a data set.

Let\'s start with the menu options.

Upload: This is similar to the \"Step 3\" button in the Automatic subapplication.  The Upload menu option will list off every data set and media captured that you may attempt to upload to iSENSE. Any upload failures will remain on this list.  However, you can choose to press and hold a data set or picture and delete it from the list permanently. Pressing and holding it will also allow you to rename your data set or change the data saved within that data set. Performing a single tap on these data sets and pictures will toggle the checkmark and \"X\" icon in the upper right of the data set or picture, indicating whether or not the application should attempt to upload it when you hit Upload.

Experiment: This option lets you select a new experiment to enter data into.  Again, once you select an experiment, the manual application will list off the experiment\'s fields and give you text boxes to enter data into.

Login: An essential step in uploading data to iSENSE is logging in.  This menu option is the stereotypical dialog that prompts for your username and password to the iSENSE website and attempts to log you in.  You will be informed if your login information was or cannot be validated.

You will notice a few additional features on the main screen.  Underneath the main iSENSE logo are two text fields that will let you know who you are currently logged in as and what experiment you are currently entering data for.  There are also 3 buttons and an additional text box right above the list of experiment fields.

Save: This button is used to save your data set once you enter data into your experiment\'s fields.  Every time you hit Save, a new data set will be saved and added to the list of data to upload with the Upload menu option.

Clear: This button is optional to using this application, but it is generally helpful.  Upon saving data, all fields and session name will remain on the main screen.  However, the Clear button will erase all of your data fields and clear your session name, giving you a blank list of experiment fields to again enter data into and save a new data set.

Session Name: This text box is the place for you to enter a session name, which is the name you want associated with your data set.

Media: This is the button with the camera on it, to the right of the session name text box. With this button, you will be able to take pictures and videos that will all save to your SD Card.  Since iSENSE supports pictures, these pictures will also be uploaded and associated with the same experiment your next data set saved will upload to.

If you have chosen a valid experiment with fields, you will see a scrollable list of fields and text boxes for you to begin entering data into.  Once all the fields you want to fill out are filled in, you may hit Save, and these values will be stored as a data set.  If a text field is labeled \"Auto\", you cannot modify its value - we will fill in that value for you when you hit Save.

All other features and error messages will be self-explanatory as they appear in the Manual subapplication.

Thank you for choosing to use our Data Collector application.  We hope you enjoy using it in conjunction with the iSENSE experience!
