App prototypes for iOS will be found here.

Also, zxing is not owned by us. It is a free, open
source, distributable library that allows for QR 
code scanning. It is committed in this iOS directory 
as it makes possible the use of relative paths 
to reference zxing's project into our code across 
multiple computers.  Also, it's the only version 
we want to be using right now.
